**Dear {Avatar Name},**

**Welcome to The Vassal Game!**

In our great Empire, as sapient beings increase in magical power and tier-up, they enjoy longer lifespans. By Tier 15, they achieve functional immortality, able to sustain perfect health solely through Mana Cultivation. However, with over 10 trillion citizens older than 5 million years, space has become a premium.

By Tier 25, a being should master interplanar teleportation. The Empire currently employs millions of Tier 25 monks who traverse the multiverse, seeking new worlds suitable for colonization. These worlds undergo a process of adjustment: we stabilize their solar systems, terraform the planets, seed them with flora and fauna, and Uplift a local species to sapience.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to join the competition to guide one such world. You will be tasked with overseeing its development from the ground up, starting with the cultivation of its mana resources to support an interplanar teleportation terminal.

**Your New Role:** If you accept, you will be granted:

* 1,000 acres on planet Cultiva: U1-G23-N-04-015-03.
* A team of 11 newly uplifted fauns, whose charm and ingenuity will assist in your endeavors.
* A starter pack of essential resources to begin construction of your manor.

Your goal is to evolve this land from a mere shrine beside a well into a thriving city-state with both planetary and interplanetary influence.

**The Challenge:** The ruler of the fief to generate the highest mana per day at the time the planet advances to Tier 1 will not only assume governance of the entire world but also earn the prestigious right to name it.

**We wish you the best of luck in this noble endeavor and hope to see you triumph!**

**With respectful regards,**

**Humble Mingzhu**  
*On behalf of Emperor Chakravartin MMMCCCXXXI*  
*In the 27,981st year of Her Illustrious Reign*
